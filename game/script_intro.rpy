    scene intro village
    s "Plwmp is a small village on the edge of the wilderness"
    s "The weather is cold, the wind blows hard and it is difficult to scratch a living"
    s "In the depths of winter, the villagers huddle round their fires, safe against the beasts and evil spirits that stalk the land"

    scene intro myfanwy
    s "At the edge of the village lived a wise woman"
    s "Myfanwy knew the ways of the wilds, the mysteries of the forest, herb-lore and how to survive alone in the wilderness"
    s "The inhabitants of Plwmp treat Myfanwy with caution when she visits the village. She is grumpy and rude. She is also powerful and dangerous"
    s "But if a villager ails or an animal falls sick, they seek her out. For gold, food or a favour she provides a potion or a salve
        that delivers a cure. Even though there might be a price to be paid"

    scene intro meri
    s "Mereianaville ap Cerevanian was a young orphan of 18 summers living in the village. Her house was covered by a big snow drift during a storm and collapsed"
    s "Her parents perished but other villagers dug Mereinville out from under the snow. She was cold, shivering and had lost everything"
    s "She didn't cry. Instead her big brown eyes were pools of deep sadness. So much so that the villagers couldn't meet her gaze"
    s "Myfanwy was asked to help. She gave Mereinaville a draught to warm her body and ease her mind, letting the poor girl fall into a deep sleep"
    s "When Merienville awoke, Myfanwy gazed into those deep brown eyes and said she would care for the girl"
    s "The villagers didn't like the idea. But food was scarce. And nobody was going to say no to Myfanwy"
    s "So Mereinville came to live with Myfanwy at her house in the woods"
    s "Myfanwy told her that Mereinville was far too long a name and she would call her Meri"

    scene intro myfanwy making potion
    s "The witch's small, tumbledown house deep in the forest sat on top of a network of caves where she lived and did her work"
    s "Meri kept the place tidy, grinding up roots and spices for Myfanwy's potions, lighting fires, doing the laundry and fetching Myfanwy a cup of tea when she wanted one"
    s "It wasn't too bad living with Myfanwy. She was miserable, taciturn, grumpy and a little smelly but Meri was well-fed, warm and didn't have to work too hard"
    s "Most of the time, Myfanwy worked in her laboratory, brewing potions. Meri wasn't allowed in there on her own" 
    s "Meri had also glimpsed a library full of dusty old tomes. Again this was out of bounds, secured by magical locks"
    s "Myfanwy was always experimenting. There were rumours she could make powerful concoctions. Love potions, deadly poisons and a salve that would stop ageing"
    s "There is a legend that a local farmer, besotted with a local girl, bought a love potion, hoping she would drink it and marry him"
    s "He was a handsome man and Myfanwy's price was a kiss. He shut his eyes, steeling himself to kiss the crone. She had the potion in her mouth and when they kissed, he was forced to drink"
    s "Shocked, he opened his eyes and was immediately entranced by the witch. He was never seen again"

    scene intro lab explosion

    s "One morning, Myfanwy was in the laboratory and there was suddenly a loud explosion"
    s "Meri rushed to the door and knocked but there's no answer. She knocked again but silence. There's a strong, unpleasant smell and Mwyfanwy seemed to have has disappeared"
